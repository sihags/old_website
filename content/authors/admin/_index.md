I am a PhD candidate in the ECSE Department at RPI, working under the supervision of Prof. Ali Tajer.  My research background is in the general areas of theoretical statistical learning and inference over networks. My research leverages the tools from information theory, statistics, graph theory, statistical learning, signal processing, and optimization.
